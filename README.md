# go-beagle-boot

A bootloader flasher for BeagleBone implemented in Go.

This project is a Go port of [node-beagle-boot](https://github.com/ravikp7/node-beagle-boot), 
because Go suits my (our) use case better. RNDIS communication is basically verbatim copied from node-beagle-boot.

## Tested devices

BeagleBone Green

## Tested platfoms

Linux, Windows (with libusb-compatible driver)
Should work on MacOS(Darwin) as well
